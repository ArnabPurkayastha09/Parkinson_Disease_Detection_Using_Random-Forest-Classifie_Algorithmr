# Parkinson_Disease_Detection_Using_Random-Forest-Classifier_Algorithm(machine learning algorithm)
  1.OpenCV( will be used to read, process, and display images)
 
  2.NumPy(NumPy will calculate statistics and grab random indices)
  
  3.Scikit-learn(RandomForestClassifier,LabelEncoder wil encode labels as integers,confusion_matrix will be built 
                 so that we can derive raw accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity)
  
  4.Scikit-image(feature wil import Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG))
  
  5.imutils(build_montages for visualization and paths wil extract the file paths to each of the images in our dataset.)
  
  6.argparse(parse command line arguments)
  
  7.OS (accommodate both Unix and Windows file paths with the os module)
  
  8.Spiral/wave dataset(dataset  was created by Adriano de Oliveira Andrade and Joao Paulo Folado from the NIATS of Federal University of Uberlândia)
  
  9.Google colab
  
  
   Geometric drawings can be used to detect and predict Parkinson’s disease.
   We can predict Parkinson with 83.33% accuracy using standard computer vision and machine learning algorithms.
   HOG image descriptor to quantify the input images and then we can train a Random Forest classifier.
